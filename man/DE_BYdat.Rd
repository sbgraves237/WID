ISO country or region code. These are 2-letter country codes.
For regions within countries, the 2 letters for that country are
followed by "-" and another 2 or 3 characters. All upper case.

\item{variable}{
code for the variable, e.g., \code{sfiinct992} and \code{sptinct992}, further
described in \code{DE_BYmeta}.

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{ The complete WID variable codes (e.g., `sfiinct992` and `sptinct992`) 
 obey to the following logic:
   * the first letter indicates the variable type (i.e. "s" for share).
   * the next five letters indicate the income/wealth/other concept 
     (e.g., `fiinc` for "Fiscal income" and `ptinc` for "pre-tax 
     national income").
   * the next letter indicate the population unit described with `pop`
     below. 
   * the last three characters indicate the age group (e.g. "992" for 
     adults).

\item{percentile}{
code for percentile, e.g., \code{p0p100} for everyone and \code{p99p99.9} for

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{ There are two types of percentiles in WID data: 
 (1) group percentiles and 
 (2) generalized percentiles. 
 The interpretation of income (or wealth) average, 
 share or threshold series depends on which type of percentile is 
 looked at.
 
 Generalized percentiles (g-percentiles) are defined to as follows: 
 p0, p1, p2, ..., p99, p99.1, p99.2, ..., p99.9, p99.91, p99.92, ..., 
 p99.99, p99.991, p99.992 ,..., p99.999. 
 There are 127 g-percentiles in total, but none appear in `DE-BY` and 
 `US`.

\description{
Data on Bavaria from the World Inequality Database (WID).
This is one of 422 countries and regions downloaded 2025-10-27.
It was selected as one of the smallest datasets in WID.
It is included here to help demonstrate the features of this package.

These datasets come in pairs with data in a file with a name like
\code{WID_data_DE-BY.csv} and corresponding metadata in a file with a name like
WID_metadata_DE-BY.csv", read using \link{read.csv2} into \code{DE_BYdat} and
\code{DE_BYmeta}, respectively. In this example, \code{DE} is the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2}{\verb{ISO 3166-1 alpha-2}}
code for Germany ("Deutschland", in German), and \code{DE-BY} is the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166}{\verb{ISO 3166}} code for
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bavaria}{Bavaria} ("Bayern" in German).

\code{DE_BYdat} is a \code{\link{data.frame}} with 7 columns: \code{country}, \code{variable},
\code{percentile}, \code{year}, \code{value}, \code{age}, and \code{pop}.

\code{DE_BYmeta} is a \verb{data.frame with 19 columns: }country\verb{, }variable\verb{, }age\verb{,  }pop\verb{, }countryname\verb{, }shortname\verb{, }simpledes\verb{, }technicaldes\verb{, }shorttype\verb{,  }longtype\verb{, }shortpop\verb{, }longpop\verb{, }shortage\verb{, }longage\verb{, }unit\verb{, }source\verb{,  }method\verb{, }extrapolation\verb{, and }data_points`, with the following definitions
for the different variables:

table(DE_BYdat$percentile) # should be 4 each of

table(DE_BYdat$age) # should be `c(992=24)` = adults, i.e., over age 20. 

table(DE_BYdat$pop) # should be `c(t=24)`. 

## DE_BYmeta
table(DE_BYmeta$country) # should be `DE_BY` for both observations. 
table(DE_BYmeta$countryname) # should be `Bavaria` for both observations. 
table(DE_BYmeta$variable) # should be `c(sfiinct992=1, sptinct992=1) 

table(DE_BYmeta$age) # should be `c(992=2)` = adults, i.e., over age 20. 

table(DE_BYmeta$pop) # should be `c(t=2)` for tax unit.
